This repo outlines the implementation phase of the "Human Digital Twins - Understanding University Student Behaviour Over Time" research project. This phase focuses on developing predictive models for student academic performance using clickstream data (Dataset: OULAD) using an LSTM Neural Network, laying the foundation for future extensions like detecting academic exhaustion and procrastination.
